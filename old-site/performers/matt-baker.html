                <h2>Matt Baker</h2>
                
                <p>Matt Baker’s headline comedy show has been making colleges, corporate functions, 
                festivals and special events just like yours fun and exciting for over 10 years. Matt 
                has performed over 2,000 shows in 14 different countries and in every imaginable scenario. 
                He is easy to work with, flexible and his show is self-contained which allows you to focus 
                on the aspects of your event that actually need your attention.</p>

                <p>“Hilarious and amazing” is how the Seattle Times describes Matt Baker’s comedy stunt show. 
                Matt’s show is a unique combination of a hilarious stand up comedy and amazing stunts. His hip, 
                energetic, comedy stunt show is action packed with funny stories, audience participation and 
                incredible skills that engage even the toughest crowd. His unique comfort level on stage sets 
                the crowd at ease and allows them to want to be involved in every show. With clever comedy and 
                jaw dropping stunts like catching a horse with his face, spearing vegetables on spikes, escaping 
                handcuffs and juggling with his mouth, Matt’s show rivals no other. Matt even integrates custom 
                material specific to your audience. Themes, products, messages, volunteers and inside jokes are 
                things that will have your attendees talking about your event long after it’s over.</p>

                <p>Whether it’s performing his comedy stunt show or acting as master of ceremonies, Matt will 
                provide you with the type of entertainment your event deserves: the best! There are many imitators, 
                but there is only one Matt Baker.</p>
