<h1>Hi Matt!</h1>
<br>
<h2>Here's how to add new artists to your site.</h2>
<h3>GoDaddy doesn't make this super easy but lk you through it.</h3>
<h3>The only hassle is adding an artist's image. Everything else is done in this spreadsheet:<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tFTQRY0HDTZCMGWQy0helNDCgRiW73HlDQtfo9FKldg/edit?gid=691126045#gid=691126045" target="_blank">Artist Spreadsheet</a>
<br><br>
Add all the information you want about the new artist there.<br>
Note that each new paragraph in their description should go into its own column.<br>
<br>
To add the image, go to your sites' File Manager: <br>
<br>
<a href="https://p3plzcpnl506885.prod.phx3.secureserver.net:2083/cpsess8794044850/frontend/jupiter/filemanager/index.html">https://p3plzcpnl506885.prod.phx3.secureserver.net:2083/cpsess8794044850/frontend/jupiter/filemanager/index.html</a>
<br><br>
Then enter the public_html folder:<br>
<img src="./public-html.jpg">
<br>
<br>Then enter the "mattbakercomedy.com" folder, then the "assets" folder, then the "images" folder after that:<br>
<!-- <img src="./assets.jpg"> -->
<br>
Then click on the Upload button:<br>
<img src="./upload.jpg">
<br><br>
Then upload the image you want to use for the new artist, and add its filename (e.g. "curt-carlyle.jpg") to the spreadsheet in the "IMAGE NAME" column.<br>
<br>
Then you're done! If you ever want to change an artist on the site, you can just change it on the spreadsheet; to remove an artist, you can just delete their row.<br>
