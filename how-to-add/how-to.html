<h1>Hi Matt!</h1>
<h2>Here's how to add new artists to your site.</h2>
<h3>First, upload the artist's image to the server:</h3>
<h4>1. Make sure you're logged into GoDaddy, and then go to your Sites Hub: <a href="https://hub.godaddy.com/sites/list">https://hub.godaddy.com/sites/list</a><br>
<br>
2. Find mattbakercomedy.com and enter the cPanel by clicking this icon:<br>

<br><br>
3. Then go into the File Manager:<br>

<br><br>
4. Then enter the public_html folder:<br>
<img src="./public-html.jpg">
<br><br>
5. Navigate into the "mattbakercomedy.com" folder, through "assets" folder, and into the "images" folder.<br>
<br>
6. Once in the "images" folder, click on the Upload button:<br>
<img src="./upload.jpg">
<br><br>
7. Upload the image you want to use for the new artist, whose filename you put into the "IMAGE NAME" column. IMPORTANT: filenames are case sensitive!<br>
<br>
8. Last, add the artist info on this sheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tFTQRY0HDTZCMGWQy0helNDCgRiW73HlDQtfo9FKldg/edit?gid=691126045#gid=691126045" target="_blank">Artist Spreadsheet</a></h3>
<p>
- ARTIST: the artist's name (e.g. "Matt Baker")<br>
- BYLINE: the artist's short byline (e.g. "Comedy + Stunt Show")<br>
- CATEGORY: jugglers, magicians, comedians, or variety<br>
- IMAGE NAME: the exact filename of the image you're going to upload (see below)<br>
- ALT TEXT: a short description of the image in text, important for accessibility (which affects your placement in web searches)<br>
- VIDEO LINK: a link to your artist's online video (you can leave this empty if none exists)<br>
- BIO: the first paragraph of the artist's bio<br>
- BIO 2: the second paragraph of the artist's bio<br>
- BIO 3: the third paragraph of the artist's bio, and so on.<br>
(you can add as many paragraphs as you want!)<br>
<br>
Once you've added the info to the spreadsheet, it'll show up on the sites! If you ever want to change an artist on the site, you can just change it on the spreadsheet; to remove an artist, you can just delete their row.<br></h4>
