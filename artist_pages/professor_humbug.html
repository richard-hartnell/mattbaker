<h2>Professor Humbug's Flea Circus</h2>
<p>The world's most popular "little" attraction... known on three continents and parts of New Jersey. 
                Professor Humbug’s is a cruelty free Victorian style flea circus, which has never failed to delight 
                even the most skeptical of audiences, and all audience members who do not wear corrective eyewear have 
                no trouble seeing the fleas...even from a distance.</p>
<p>The fleas perform daring acts such as the trapeze and the high dive, all directed by the Professor 
                and easily seen by the audience. But don’t get too comfortable in your seat, because Professor Humbug 
                needs a lot of help to get the fleas to do their acts.</p>
