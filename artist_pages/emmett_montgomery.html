<h2>Emmett Montgomery</h2>
<p>Utah born, Seattle based comedian Emmett Montgomery found the comedy stage in late 2004 and has been 
                failing beautifully ever since. Emmett has been involved in a lot of things including critically acclaimed 
                comedy collectives, post apocalyptic variety shows, underground wrestling leagues and family friendly comedy 
                nights in pizza restaurants. Mr. Montgomery has been featured the film “Seattle Komedy Documentary”, the 
                coffee table book “Seattle 100: a portrait of a city” and the Bumbershoot, Bridgetown Comedy and Sasquatch 
                festivals. In addition to wandering the country telling jokes he currently curates and hosts a love letter to 
                Seattle in the form of variety show/sharing party entitled “Weird and Awesome with Emmett Montgomery” at the 
                prestigious Annex Theatre once a month and hosts a very rowdy weekly open mic at one of Seattle’s most storied 
                gay karaoke bars, the Crescent. Emmett tells jokes from his heart. His heart is usually full of hope but 
                sometimes it is full of spiders.</p>
