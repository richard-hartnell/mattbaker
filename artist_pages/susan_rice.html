<h2>Susan Rice</h2>
<p>For  30 years Susan Rice has been sharing her quirky sense of humor with audiences young 
                and old. She is funny, familiar and that is probably the reason she’s still single. She is 
                never a stranger. Rice is the kind of comic that brings everyone back to that one beloved 
                relative who was the first to show up and the last to leave.  Everyone loved her until the 
                second glass of wine.</p>
<p>Raised in the Pacific Northwest Rice still resides in Portland but lived and worked in Los Angeles for over 15 years. 
                She has performed all over the US and Canada and has been seen on Comedy Central, Showtime and was a featured performer at the HBO’s
                Comedy Festival at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas and Portland Oregon’s Bridgetown Comedy Festival 
                and is now working with Relay for Life to help groups raise funds to fight cancer. </p>
<p>She has performed with some of the greats; Jerry Seinfeld, Paula Poundstone, Maria Bamford. 
                She has done all the comedy shows of the 90’s A&amp; E’s Evening at the Improv, Showtime’s Comedy on the Road All Stars.  </p>
<p>When asked recently why she chose a career in Stand Up comedy Rice replied “It got to a point 
                where making people laugh on the bus just got annoying.</p>
<p>With all her years in comedy Rice has maintained her love of the art.” It is such a privilege to 
                make people laugh it crosses all boundaries of age and sex and gives everyone a moment of respite 
                from their everyday troubles.  It’s good for the soul.</p>
<p>When Susan hits the stage the audience automatically finds her fun and familiar. 
                She is the perfect fit for any show or event.</p>
