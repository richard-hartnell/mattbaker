<h2>Travis Nelson</h2>
<p>Travis was raised where Kurt Cobain learned to smile, in Grays Harbor, near the rain forests of Washington State. The lack of sunshine and abundance of caffeine fostered his obsessive personality. With an act that intertwines real experiences with absurd and imaginative meanderings, he invites the audience to escape into the sometimes dark but always lighthearted playground of his psyche.
