<h2>The Checkerboard Guy</h2>
<p>Since 1981 David Aiken has performed as ‘The Checkerboard Guy,’ a Comic Daredevil who’s manic energy, zany sense 
                of humour and robust skill set have been his passport to the globe! His award-winning comedic variety show has been 
                compared to Steve Martin, Pee Wee Herman, and even a live action version of The Simpsons. Bottom line–his infectious 
                energy and crazy stunts will leave you rolling in the aisles!</p>
