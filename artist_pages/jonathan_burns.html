<h2>Jonathan Burns: Life of the Party</h2>
<p>Born with the gifts of flexibility, curiosity, and goofiness, Jonathan Burns combines these unique talents to astonish
			audiences around the globe. Jonathan has wow’d the AMERICA’S GOT TALENT judges, been told by Penn Jillette he was
			”absolutely fabulous (Teller nodded along) on their show FOOL US, dazzled the audience on THE LATE LATE SHOW with James
			Corden. These are just a few of his many extraordinary TV appearances. The New York Times called him “Extremely Funny”
			and Campus Activities Magazine named him “Variety Artist of the Year” — TWICE! When he’s not performing he can usually
			be found in an airport terminal or spending time with his beautiful family.
