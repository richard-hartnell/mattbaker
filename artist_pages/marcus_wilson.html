<h2>Marcus Wilson</h2>
<p>Marcus Wilson was born on April Fools day 1973, so it seems only fitting that he has a passion for
			jokes. This passion kept him in trouble all through elementary and jr. high school. In ninth grade, he
			enrolled in a drama class and discovered a place where acting out was encouraged and accepted. He
			found that as long as he was on stage people seemed to enjoy his obnoxious antics. In high school,
			while working at a restaurant, he learned to juggle with rolls and oranges and fell in love with useless
			tricks and odd skills. At the age of 22, armed with a handful of these tricks and a desire to entertain, he
			began doing shows. About five years later, he began performing in comedy clubs. Since then, he has
			been making his living performing. Marcus lives in West Jordan, Utah. After giving his teachers such a
			hard time, he ended up married to a teacher. He has been married since 1996 and has four kids.</p>
