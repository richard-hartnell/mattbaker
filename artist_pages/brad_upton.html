<h2>Brad Upton</h2>
<p>The world is discovering comedian Brad Upton after 36 years in the standup business. Brad was teaching the fourth grade
                    and coaching high school track in Pasco, WA when he first stepped on stage in 1984. He quickly decided that he wanted to
                    do standup instead, so he quit teaching in June of 1986 and never looked back.</p>
<p>He made several cable TV appearances in the early 90’s, headlined comedy clubs from coast to coast, opened for big name
                    music acts and was hired to perform at corporate events.</p>
