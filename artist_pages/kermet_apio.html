                festivals in Aspen, Las Vegas, and Vancouver and has performed in 47 states and 3 Canadian 
                provinces. He is a past winner of the Seattle Comedy Competition and was a semi-finalist in

<p>Kermet is married and the proud father of two wonderful children. He enjoys his family, baseball, 
                and pie. He does not enjoy opera, sitting in traffic, and writing about himself in the third person.</p>
