<h2>Louie Foxx</h2>
<p>Louie’s One Man Side Show begins as a magic show, with Louie performing the first trick 
                he invented when he was five year old… but with an amazing and unexpected twist. Then the show 
                quickly changes to something totally different when Louie begins to demonstrate his other skills. 
                Some of the highlights of the show are when the audience:</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">• Gasps in awe at Louie’s bullwhip artistry demonstration!<br/>
                • Cheers on the guy in the back row as Louie teaches him to spin a lasso like a cowboy!<br/>
                • Laughs hysterically as Louie wraps his head in duct tape to play a game of 20 questions!<br/>
                • Oohs and Awes at incredible images that Louie can make with the shadows of his hands!<br/>
                • Sits in amazement as Louie breaks a world record!<br/>
                • Scratches their head in wonder as Louie’s brain works faster than a calculator!<br/>
                • Claps uncontrolably at the unexpected and impossible end of the Cup Game!<br/>
                • and much more!</p>
<p>Every show that Louie performs is full of comedy and more audience interaction than you can shake a stick at!</p>
