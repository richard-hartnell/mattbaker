<h2>Larry G Jones</h2>
<p>"Entertainer of the Year" and "Impressionist of the Year" are two titles often used to describe 
                'Comic Singing Impressionist' Larry G Jones. His one-man show also competed with Las Vegas' biggest 
                productions to prove its merit with over four years as one ofTripadvisor's 'Top Five' consumer rated Vegas shows.</p>
<p>Each customizable experience is a fast-paced and fun filled celebration of hit music mixed with hilarious clean 
                comedy. You will be highly entertained by an all-star celebrity cast of rapid-fire voice impressions including many 
                of Las Vegas' biggest headliners and Billboard's greatest artists.</p>
<p>The Temptations, Cher, Elton John, Neil Diamond, Elvis, The Phantom of the Opera, and The Rat Pack are just a small 
                sample of the 75 plus voices Larry performs in each show. When you throw a few famous comedians, Hollywood celebrities, 
                and presidential voices in the mix, there is enough comedy and music to appeal to just about everyone.</p>
