<h2>Greg Moreland</h2>
<p>Although introduced as a magician, it soon becomes clear why Greg has worked alongside some of the funniest comedians in the country -- he is hilarious as the slightly confused magician!</p>
<p>If you don’t think you like magic shows - think again; this is the magic show for people who don’t like magic shows! Relying more on comedy than on magic, this isn’t your grandfather’s magic act.  And at the same time, Greg is the rare comic performer who can entertain across an enormous range of ages. His wit and personable style allows him to connect with audiences wherever he goes, and his clean material bridges the gap between young and old alike.</p>
<p>Greg has been entertaining audiences around the world since 1983. He has performed at over 500 banquets &amp; corporate events, and his work on cruise ships has taken him to 145 countries. He has appeared in top casino showrooms, as well as having toured as the opening act for such diverse stars as Ray Charles, Tim Allen, and Weird Al Yankovich.</p>
<p>His only regret in life is that he is not someone else.</p>
<p><em>Due to unfortunate events of the past, his show will be free swimming pool chemicals, permanent markers, and prescription medications.</em></p>
