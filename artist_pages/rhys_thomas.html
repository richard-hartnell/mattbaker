<h2>Rhys Thomas</h2>
<p>From rural Oregon to stages in 30 countries, the JuggleMania journey has been three decades of adventure.  Sure he's done NBA halftimes, entertained Fortune 500 companies, opened for Weird Al Yankovich and Weird Al Gore and rocked thousands of festival and theater shows. That's all trivia. The real highlights include serving as Artist in Residence at the Smithsonian Institution, journeying to remote Egyptian tombs to discover 4,000 year old paintings of jugglers, riding a tall unicycle on the frozen Chukchee sea, juggling a 'gator in Arkansas, saving a crowd from a stampede, falling in love with a clever woman and raising two wonderfully creative daughters (who, yes, can juggle).</p>
