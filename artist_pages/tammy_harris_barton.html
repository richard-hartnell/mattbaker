<h2>Tammy Harris Barton</h2>
<p>Tammy Harris Barton has been performing as a professional stage hypnotist since 1993. She began her career 
                working with her parents both of whom are certified hypno-therapists. She quickly realized that hypnosis performed 
                correctly could be both entertaining and educational at the same time, and could allow her to obtain any goal 
                she set for herself.</p>
<p>In every show, Tammy selects willing volunteers from the audience and then puts them into a state of hypnosis. 
                She then guides them though a journey of the mind in which the volunteers act on suggestions Tammy provides. During 
                her show you never know who might show up to share her stage. Only the imagination of her volunteers will limit their 
                journey. Tammy always maintains the highest level of respect for her volunteers, and never embarrasses or humiliates 
                any one on stage. So if your looking for a High quality show, a show to keep your crowds laughing and coming back for 
                more, then Tammy is the premier entertainer you’re looking for.</p>
